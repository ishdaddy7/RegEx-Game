# RegEx-Game
## Overview
This is an early draft of a game to practice RegEx, and will have two main components:
* Play Game
* My Account

### Play Game
This is an Angular state that uses a mix of Phaser.io and Angular directives to create the game experience. Phaser.io is used for the main levels and map, and a directive will be used for the bomb defuse view.

The 'Play Game' tab previews the current, very simple functionality. You will see 5 bombs drop - each with a very short timer after which it will explode. If you collide with one of them in time, you will transition to the bomb defuse view.

Neither does very much at the moment.
